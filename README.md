Assignment 2: Robotic Body and Camera movement
----------------------------------------------
Objectives:
-----------
-Design a 3D human body.
-Apply a camera view that shows the body transformations in all directions.
-Stimulate movements of full body joints in all directions(elbows, wrests, hips, knees).

Keyboard Shortcuts for Body transformation:

Challenges:
-----------
We had difficulty in determining the origin point for each block to rotate it, we managed to fix it.
